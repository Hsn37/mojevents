            Hi, I am the owner and founder of Moj Events and Designs based in Chicago based in Glenview, a suburb of Chicago. I am a mother of four boys, and after moving to the US, I earned my degree in business administration. Still, I have always had a keen interest in arts and design throughout my life, which is why I was the event planner for most of my family's small formal events. From here, my interest grew, and I developed a career path in this field, working in this field for almost ten years now. In 2017, I decided to make an official company and make this my profession. Since then, I have covered numerous events, helping my clients execute their desires through my designs for their events. I look forward to meeting you to make your event the best day of your life.
