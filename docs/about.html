            Hi I am the owner and founder of Moj events and designs based in Chicago based in Glenview, a suburb of Chicago. I earned my degree in business administration but I always had a keen interest in arts and design throughout my life, which is why I was the event planner for most of my family's small informal events. From here my interest grew and I developed a career path into this field working in this field for almost 10 years now. In 2017 I finally decided to make an official company and make this my profession and since then I have covered numerous events, helping my clients in executing their desires through my designs for their events.  I look forward to meeting you to make your event the best day of your life.
